# Wither's Wrath 1.15 — Latest

[View Release on GitHub](https://github.com/ImHer0/witherswrath/releases/tag/1.15)

## Changes

> 1.21.11 requires changes that need a new version entirely which is ready for release, I'm just waiting for full release.

### Direct Changes to the Wither

- During the First Phase (300HP-600HP) the Wither will move away from players to maintain its distance and have more effective attacks.
- Skulls shot by the Wither have been buffed further as dangerous (blue) skulls will now have a bigger explosion doing quite a bit more damage than before leaving smoke behind.
- Wither now has less armour during the first phase and increased armour during the second phase.
- Converted Skeletons now carry bows since the mobs they convert from have bows.
- Changes to the amount of Blazes spawned during midpoint:
  - &lt;5 Players = 10 Blazes
  - &lt;10 Players = 20 Blazes
  - &gt;10 Players = 30 Blazes

### Changes to Attacks

- A swarm of smaller wither skeletons will spawn at 150HP helping the Wither deal with close range attackers.
- The Wither will now regularly shoot a burst of skulls directly at the nearest player, additionally, the skull it shot at the player in earlier versions will now be a slow fire shot marked as dangerous.

## Fixes

- Fixed Wither destroying bedrock in very specific cases.
- Reduced volume on enraged skulls — they were incredibly loud at 100%.

Enjoy! 😎
