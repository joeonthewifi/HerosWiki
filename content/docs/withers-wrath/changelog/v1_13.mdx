> Available on the 2nd page of the config!

## Bug Fixes

- The Wither trophy not summoning with metadata in older versions should now be fixed
- Some other stuff I found out myself should also be working fine now

## Disclaimer

In between updates, I added a small trophy model to the resource pack, which is also included with the mod versions. Enjoy!
