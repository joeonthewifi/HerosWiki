# Wither's Wrath 1.12

[View Release on GitHub](https://github.com/ImHer0/witherswrath/releases/tag/1.12)

**Release Date**: May 3, 2024

## New Phase – Enraged Wither (100 HP)

- In this phase all attacks are buffed:
  - Homing skulls travel faster
  - Wither skeletons spawn more often
    - Each spawn triggers 24 skulls shot outward, exploding within 1s
  - Charge attack: now does three short charges with 0.5s pauses

- Visual/audio changes:
  - Plays sound on phase start
  - Constant particles (dark mist + blue skulls/soul fire depending on version)
  - Team colour set to `dark_red` (for glow effect)

- Wither gains armour after the midpoint; it was dying too fast

Several minor issues have been fixed, including #16 

> As of this version, I have started including a download to a version with the bedrock parity only on, you can still change the settings but it might be useful for pack makers and so on.

This update supports versions 1.20.2 to 1.21.5. I've aimed for compatibility across all of them with minimal testing. If you encounter any bugs, **please open a GitHub issue**, and I'll address them in my free time.

I put too many unpaid hours into this hobby of a project.
