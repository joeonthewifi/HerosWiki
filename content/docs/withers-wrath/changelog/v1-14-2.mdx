# Wither's Wrath 1.14.2

[View Release on GitHub](https://github.com/ImHer0/witherswrath/releases/tag/1.14.2)

**Release Date**: September 30, 2024

🐞 &lt;- That's a bug!!!

## Changes
- Reworked how the wither is detected, will now work with wither's spawned through: Spawn Egg or /Summon
> Regardless of this change, the Wither can still only be spawned once at a time. If a player tries to summon another while one already exists, it will play a sound, send a message to the nearest player that only one can exist, and return the skulls and soul sand.
- Added very minimal ambient particles (ash) around the Wither.
- Compatibility with 1.21.9 is complete just use 1.21.5+ and it should work fine!

## Fixes
- Fixed destruction toggle not working as intended #24 
- Fixed multiplayer breaking some functions at spawn (hopefully for the last time)
