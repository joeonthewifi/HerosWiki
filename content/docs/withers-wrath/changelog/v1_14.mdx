## Added
- 20 seconds after the wither is spawned it will now shoot a high speed direct wither skull at a random player.

## Fixed
- Items getting killed by the thunder when the wither is killed is now fixed
- Multiplayer summon should no longer break (I'm surprised no one commented on this it's been in the pack since release 4 years ago)
- Some names were in the wrong format which are now fixed
- Fixed wither dropping armour on death due to incorrect formatting of commands in 1.21.5+
