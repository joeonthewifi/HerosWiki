## Changes

- Midpoint now throws the player up depending on how close you are to the wither smashing down.
  - Also made the wither only trigger the smash when it is on the ground instead of a time based system.
- Skeletons with Bows will now have a named bow from [Mickey Joe's "Barely Default"](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/mickey-joes-relatively-improved-default)

## Fixes

- Fixed gamerules being overridden whenever fighting the wither #23
- Fixed some selectors having the wrong format
- Fixed the trail particle at the start of the fight

Thank you for reading and supporting this project! 😎
